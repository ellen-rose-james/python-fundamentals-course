    "### **Structure of a Python Program**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python program is typically organized into the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Modules:** A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py`. Modules can define functions, classes, and variables. They provide a way to organize code into logical units and promote reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Statements:** A statement is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. Examples include assignment statements (e.g., `x = 5`), print statements (`print(\"Hello\")`), conditional statements (`if`), and loops (`for`, `while`). Statements perform actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Expressions:** An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that the Python interpreter can evaluate to produce a value. Examples include arithmetic expressions (`2 + 3`), string expressions (`\"Hello\" + \"World\"`), and logical expressions (`x > 5`). Expressions produce values."

Unlike some other programming languages, you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly in Python. The type is inferred based on the value assigned to it.\n",

    "*   **Floating-point numbers (`float`):** Numbers with a decimal point or numbers in exponential form. Examples: `3.14`, `-0.001`, `2.5e10`.\n",
    "*   **Strings (`str`):** Sequences of characters, enclosed in single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`\"`). Examples: `'Hello'`, `\"Python\"`, `'123'`.\n",
    "*   **Booleans (`bool`):** Represents truth values. It can only be either `True` or `False`. These are often used in conditional statements and logical operations."

    "*   `elif`: Short for 'else if'. Used with `if` to check multiple conditions sequentially.\n",
    "*   `for`: Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) or other iterable objects.\n",
    "*   `while`: Used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "*   `def`: Used to define a function.\n",
    "*   `import`: Used to import modules or parts of modules into the current namespace.\n",
    "*   `True`: The boolean truth value.\n",
    "*   `False`: The boolean false value.\n",
    "*   `None`: Represents the absence of a value or a null value.\n",
    "*   `and`: A logical operator that returns `True` if both operands are true.\n",
    "*   `or`: A logical operator that returns `True` if at least one operand is true.\n",
    "*   `not`: A logical operator that negates a boolean expression.\n",
    "*   `in`: A membership operator used to check if a value is present in a sequence.\n",
    "*   `is`: An identity operator used to check if two variables refer to the same object.\n",
    "*   `break`: Used to exit a loop prematurely.\n",
    "*   `continue`: Used to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next.\n",
    "*   `return`: Used in functions to return a value.\n",
    "*   `lambda`: Used to create small, anonymous functions.\n",
    "*   `class`: Used to define a class.\n",
    "*   `try`, `except`, `finally`: Used for exception handling.\n",

    "Comments are lines within a program that are ignored by the interpreter during execution. They are used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Document Code:** Explain what the code does, its purpose, and how it works. This is crucial for readability and maintainability, especially when working on large projects or collaborating with others.\n",
