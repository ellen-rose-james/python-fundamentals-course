    "### **Structure of a Python Program**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python program is typically organized into the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Modules:** A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py`. Modules can define functions, classes, and variables. They provide a way to organize code into logical units and promote reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Statements:** A statement is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. Examples include assignment statements (e.g., `x = 5`), print statements (`print(\"Hello\")`), conditional statements (`if`), and loops (`for`, `while`). Statements perform actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Expressions:** An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that the Python interpreter can evaluate to produce a value. Examples include arithmetic expressions (`2 + 3`), string expressions (`\"Hello\" + \"World\"`), and logical expressions (`x > 5`). Expressions produce values."

    "### **Variables and Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables are used to store data values. You can think of a variable as a named container that holds a piece of information. Unlike some other programming languages, you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly in Python. The type is inferred based on the value assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable assignment is done using the equals sign (`=`). The variable name is on the left side of the `=`, and the value you want to store in it is on the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several built-in fundamental data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Integers (`int`):** Whole numbers, positive or negative, without a decimal point. Examples: `10`, `-5`, `0`.\n",
    "*   **Floating-point numbers (`float`):** Numbers with a decimal point or numbers in exponential form. Examples: `3.14`, `-0.001`, `2.5e10`.\n",
    "*   **Strings (`str`):** Sequences of characters, enclosed in single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`\"`). Examples: `'Hello'`, `\"Python\"`, `'123'`.\n",
    "*   **Booleans (`bool`):** Represents truth values. It can only be either `True` or `False`. These are often used in conditional statements and logical operations."

    "\n",
    "Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language. You cannot use keywords as variable names, function names, or any other identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common Python keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `if`: Used to start a conditional statement. Executes a block of code if a condition is true.\n",
    "*   `else`: Used with `if` or `elif`. Executes a block of code if the condition in the preceding `if` or `elif` is false.\n",
    "*   `elif`: Short for 'else if'. Used with `if` to check multiple conditions sequentially.\n",
    "*   `for`: Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) or other iterable objects.\n",
    "*   `while`: Used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "*   `def`: Used to define a function.\n",
    "*   `import`: Used to import modules or parts of modules into the current namespace.\n",
    "*   `True`: The boolean truth value.\n",
    "*   `False`: The boolean false value.\n",
    "*   `None`: Represents the absence of a value or a null value.\n",
    "*   `and`: A logical operator that returns `True` if both operands are true.\n",
    "*   `or`: A logical operator that returns `True` if at least one operand is true.\n",
    "*   `not`: A logical operator that negates a boolean expression.\n",
    "*   `in`: A membership operator used to check if a value is present in a sequence.\n",
    "*   `is`: An identity operator used to check if two variables refer to the same object.\n",
    "*   `break`: Used to exit a loop prematurely.\n",
    "*   `continue`: Used to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next.\n",
    "*   `return`: Used in functions to return a value.\n",
    "*   `lambda`: Used to create small, anonymous functions.\n",
    "*   `class`: Used to define a class.\n",
    "*   `try`, `except`, `finally`: Used for exception handling.\n",
    "*   `with`: Used for resource management (e.g., working with files).\n",
    "*   `as`: Used to create an alias when importing modules or with the `with` statement."
