    "### **Structure of a Python Program**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python program is typically organized into the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Modules:** A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py`. Modules can define functions, classes, and variables. They provide a way to organize code into logical units and promote reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Statements:** A statement is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. Examples include assignment statements (e.g., `x = 5`), print statements (`print(\"Hello\")`), conditional statements (`if`), and loops (`for`, `while`). Statements perform actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Expressions:** An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that the Python interpreter can evaluate to produce a value. Examples include arithmetic expressions (`2 + 3`), string expressions (`\"Hello\" + \"World\"`), and logical expressions (`x > 5`). Expressions produce values."

    "### **Variables and Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables are used to store data values. You can think of a variable as a named container that holds a piece of information. Unlike some other programming languages, you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly in Python. The type is inferred based on the value assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable assignment is done using the equals sign (`=`). The variable name is on the left side of the `=`, and the value you want to store in it is on the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several built-in fundamental data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Integers (`int`):** Whole numbers, positive or negative, without a decimal point. Examples: `10`, `-5`, `0`.\n",
    "*   **Floating-point numbers (`float`):** Numbers with a decimal point or numbers in exponential form. Examples: `3.14`, `-0.001`, `2.5e10`.\n",
    "*   **Strings (`str`):** Sequences of characters, enclosed in single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`\"`). Examples: `'Hello'`, `\"Python\"`, `'123'`.\n",
    "*   **Booleans (`bool`):** Represents truth values. It can only be either `True` or `False`. These are often used in conditional statements and logical operations."
